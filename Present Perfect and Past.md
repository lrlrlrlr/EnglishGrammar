# Present perfect (I have done)
* The present perfect simple is **have/has** + *past participle*. ( I've .../ He's ...)
* When we say that 'something has happened', this is usually **new inforamtion**.
* When we use the present perfect, there is a connection with ***now***. The action in the past has a result now.
* `gone(to)`和`been(to)`的区别：
    * James is on holiday. He **has gone to** Italy. (== he is there now or on his way there)
    * Jane is back home now. She **has been to** Italy. (== she has now come back)
