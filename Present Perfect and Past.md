# Present perfect (I have done)
* The present perfect simple is **have/has** + *past participle*. ( I've .../ He's ...) 一般用于描述**曾做过某事...**，与一般过去时的区别主要是用于更加强调过去完成的这件事对现在的影响。
* When we say that 'something has happened', this is usually **new inforamtion**.
* When we use the present perfect, there is a connection with ***now***. The action in the past has a result now.
* `gone(to)`和`been(to)`的区别：
    * James is on holiday. He **has gone to** Italy. (== he is there now or on his way there)
    * Jane is back home now. She **has been to** Italy. (== she has now come back)
* Use the present perfect with **just**/**already**/**yet**:
   * just : a short time ago
   * already : happen sooner than expected ,表“已经”
   * yet：==until now ,仅用于疑问句和否定句
* **It's the (first) time** sth has happen... : **表第n次发生某事**通常都用现在完成时
* 现在完成时和一般现在时通常可以通用： `Have you had a holiday this year? == Did you have a holiday this year?`  
   * `现在完成时 Have you had lunch?` 与 `一般过去时 Did you have lunch?` 意思差不多，但是Have you通常是表近一段时间（比如问今晚吃了吗），有一种“你饿了吗”的意思在里面； 而Did you则通常是用来问一些比较远的时间（比如昨天你吃了吗），与现在关联不大。

# Present perfect continuous (I have been doing)
* `It has been raining.` -- An activity that has recently stopped or just stopped, and **there is a connection with now**.
*  常用于**表示、问：某事发生了多久**`how long....? --It's xx for n hours / since xxx.` : 代表某件事现在仍在发生，或者刚刚结束。

# 现在完成时和现在完成进行时的区别（I have been doing and I have done）：
*  I've been doing sth. == 我刚刚在干这件事，可能干完了，也可能没干完，现在还在干；强调的是这个**动作**。
*  I've done sth. == 我之前干完这件事了；强调的是**结果**。
* 通常用I've been doing sth来描述**How long**:
   * How long have you been reading that book?
   * They have been playing tennis since 2 o'clock.
* 通常用I've done sth描述**How much/How many/How many times**:
   * How much of that book have you read?
   * Lisa is writing emails. She has sent a lot of emails this morning.
   * They have played tennis three times this week.
*  Have you been playing tennis? == Have you ever played tennis?
* **know/like/believe**通常不适用I've been doing:
   * I have known (not I have been knowing)
   * How long have you hading that camera? ( not have you been having)
* **live/work**通常两边都可以用
	* She has been living here for a long time.
	* She has lived here for a long time.
* 如需要表从什么时候就没干过某事了：I haven't done sth since/for ...
	* I haven't seen Tom since Monday. (== Monday was the last day I saw him.)
	* She hasn't phoned for ages. (== the last time she phoned was ages ago.)
* How long have you had .. 与  How long have you been having .. 的区别：
	* You would use "had" for a possession or other permanent object like the camera in your example. 表示拥有某物通常用`have..had`.
	* You would use "been having" for events (especially a series of events) or other duration-based things
		* How long have you been having these parties?
		* How long have you been having these symptoms?
