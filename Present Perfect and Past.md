# Present perfect (I have done)
* The present perfect simple is **have/has** + *past participle*. ( I've .../ He's ...)
* When we say that 'something has happened', this is usually **new inforamtion**.
* When we use the present perfect, there is a connection with ***now***. The action in the past has a result now.
* `gone(to)`和`been(to)`的区别：
    * James is on holiday. He **has gone to** Italy. (== he is there now or on his way there)
    * Jane is back home now. She **has been to** Italy. (== she has now come back)
* Use the present perfect with **just**/**already**/**yet**:
   * just : a short time ago
   * already : happen sooner than expected ,表“已经”
   * yet：==until now ,仅用于疑问句和否定句
* **It's the (first) time** sth has happen... : 表第n次发生某事通常都用现在完成时
* 现在完成时和一般现在时通常可以通用： `Have you had a holiday this year? == Did you have a holiday this year?`  
   * `现在完成时 Have you had lunch?` 与 `一般过去时 Did you have lunch?` 意思差不多，但是Have you通常是表近一段时间（比如问今晚吃了吗），有一种“你饿了吗”的意思在里面； 而Did you则通常是用来问一些比较远的时间（比如昨天你吃了吗），与现在关联不大。

# Present perfect continuous (I have been doing)
* `It has been raining.` -- An activity that has recently stopped or just stopped, and **there is a connection with now**.
*  常用于`how long....? --It's xx for n hours / since xxx.` : 代表某件事现在仍在发生，或者刚刚结束。
