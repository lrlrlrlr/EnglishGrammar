# Boat
1. Have you ever travelled by boat?
To be honest, I have only taken a boat just for a short boat ride and I have never travelled by boat. I suppose most of travellers including me, would choose to travel by train or plane, which is more convenient and fast.
2. Do you like boats?
Yes, I do like boats, floating in a boat with a gentle breeze brushes face, it is a wonderful experience. I think it provides a different angle to observe the world. When I sit in the boat, I just feel really close to the lake and nature.
3. Would you like to have your own boat?
Yes, of course, I would like to have my own boat, but the boat that I want is not like those fishermen's. I like those fancy ones and somehow a fancy boat represents the wealth, I wish my dream could come true one day.
4. Is boat trip popular in your country?
Actually, boat trip is not that popular in China, because China is a continental country and there are not many chances for citizens to have a boat trip. However, if I have a chance to travel by boat, I would like to try it since it will be a totally different experience for me.


# Bus
1. How often do you take the bus?
Actually, I should say that I take the bus almost every day and it is really convenient for us to take a bus to everywhere we want, I admit that public transportation has been developed really well these days.
2. When was the first time you took a bus?
Well, that's an interesting question. I started to take a bus ever since I could remember, maybe since I was born. When I was a little, not every family owns a car. Therefore, the main means of transportation was bus.
3. Is it convenient to take the bus in your city?
Yes, I think bus still is the most common way for citizens because of the completed public transportation system. Sometimes the destination is far away and it will take us more than an hour to get there, but we still could get everywhere in the city by bus. I'd say it is really convenient for us.
4. Do people in your country take the bus?
Yes, we do. In China, we are facing a serious problem which is traffic jam. The number of private cars has been expanding significantly and occupied large social resources. Taking the bus helps to relieve the traffic congestion and good for the environment, too.


# Computer
1. How often do you use computer?
I use computer almost every day, sometimes for study/work, sometimes just for fun, such as playing games and watching videos. I suppose computer already became one of necessities of life, especially for the young generation.

2. What kinds of computers are popular in China?
Well, in China, most people use desktop and laptop together since both of them have their own advantages. A desktop usually used at home or office and it has better expansibility, while a laptop is often for personal use and it is more convenient to carry with.

3. What do you usually use your computer for?
I usually use computer to dealing with the things are related to my work, you know, things like writing reports, sending emails to colleagues and making PowerPoint for presentation. Sometimes, I play games or watch videos to release stress from work.

4. Who taught you how to use a computer?
I remember it was my dad who taught me how to use computer. When I was a little, he taught me how to type by playing some typing games with me. After I went to elementary school, I had computer class so I learned more about computer then.

5. Do you think computers have changed your life a lot?
Definitely! I could say I cannot live without computer now. Computer truly brought convenience to us from study to work, from office time to leisure time. Our life would be totally different if there's no computer.


# Email
1. Do you write many emails?
I do write emails but not that many, only when I have to send report to my boss. For other things that are less formal, I often communicate by cellphone or social media like Wechat, it's more convenient for both of us.  

2. How often do you write an email?
Almost several times a week, just like I mentioned before, I write emails when I have to send report to my boss. I don't have that many things must be done by email through.  

3. What are the differences between emails and letters?
Well, first is about the efficiency, emails absolutely run faster than letters so when we are doing some business, we always use emails to catch up with time. However, letters have more things to do with emotions and it's a good way to communicate with friends and families by letters.  

4. What kinds of email do you think are the hardest to write?
I suppose the hardest email would relate to self-introduction. You know, sometimes when we apply for a school or for a job, it is necessary to give a self-introduction by email. It is hard to let people know you well only through an email.  
 
5. How do you feel when you receive emails?
 To be honest, I always feel a little bit nervous when I receive emails, I know it sounds weird but I really do. Maybe because I don't know what's inside of the email before I click it and people often get scared of the unknown things.

6. What kinds of emails do you receive that make you feel excited?
Of course are those emails that contain good news. For me and also for most of students who are taking this exam, I believe the answer would be a school offer because that's what I am fighting for. 

7. How do you communicate with others at work-by emails or is it more convenient?
When talking about things that are official or formal, an email is a good choice since emails could contain more detailed information and more clearly to be understood. Except for this, I would choose to use cellphone.


# Family    
1. How often do you meet with your family?    
The city I am living now is not my hometown, I can only go back to meet my family on holidays maybe once a few months. However, I always talk with my family through the webcam and sometimes I really miss them.    

2. How do you spend the time with your family?    
Just like normal families, we do most of things together, such as watching TV, cooking, playing games, or just have a short conversation, nothing special. On weekends, we often drive to a nearby countryside and enjoy sunlight and breeze.    

3. Do you want to live with your family in the future?
 After I get married, then my answer would be no. We need to be more independent and take care of our nuclear family. However, after my parents are growing old and I will live with them and take care of them, it's our responsibility.    

4. Are you close to all of your family members?    
Not all of them, but most of them. Chinese have close family relationships and we tend to live as one big family. Therefore, I am close to most of my family members, except for those who are living in other cities.    

5. How has your family influenced you?    
I got influenced by my parents most since we have been living together for so many years. They not only taught me the knowledge I need, but also helped me to form a good personality. I have learnt a lot from them.
