# Boat
1. Have you ever travelled by boat?
To be honest, I have only taken a boat just for a short boat ride and I have never travelled by boat. I suppose most of travellers including me, would choose to travel by train or plane, which is more convenient and fast.
2. Do you like boats?
Yes, I do like boats, floating in a boat with a gentle breeze brushes face, it is a wonderful experience. I think it provides a different angle to observe the world. When I sit in the boat, I just feel really close to the lake and nature.
3. Would you like to have your own boat?
Yes, of course, I would like to have my own boat, but the boat that I want is not like those fishermen's. I like those fancy ones and somehow a fancy boat represents the wealth, I wish my dream could come true one day.
4. Is boat trip popular in your country?
Actually, boat trip is not that popular in China, because China is a continental country and there are not many chances for citizens to have a boat trip. However, if I have a chance to travel by boat, I would like to try it since it will be a totally different experience for me.


# Bus
1. How often do you take the bus?
Actually, I should say that I take the bus almost every day and it is really convenient for us to take a bus to everywhere we want, I admit that public transportation has been developed really well these days.
2. When was the first time you took a bus?
Well, that's an interesting question. I started to take a bus ever since I could remember, maybe since I was born. When I was a little, not every family owns a car. Therefore, the main means of transportation was bus.
3. Is it convenient to take the bus in your city?
Yes, I think bus still is the most common way for citizens because of the completed public transportation system. Sometimes the destination is far away and it will take us more than an hour to get there, but we still could get everywhere in the city by bus. I'd say it is really convenient for us.
4. Do people in your country take the bus?
Yes, we do. In China, we are facing a serious problem which is traffic jam. The number of private cars has been expanding significantly and occupied large social resources. Taking the bus helps to relieve the traffic congestion and good for the environment, too.
