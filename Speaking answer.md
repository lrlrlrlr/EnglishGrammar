4. Is boat trip popular in your country?
Actually, boat trip is not that popular in China, because China is a continental country and there are not many chances for citizens to have a boat trip. However, if I have a chance to travel by boat, I would like to try it since it will be a totally different experience for me.

2. When was the first time you took a bus?
Well, that's an interesting question. I started to take a bus ever since I could remember, maybe since I was born. When I was a little, not every family owns a car. Therefore, the main means of transportation was bus.
3. Is it convenient to take the bus in your city?
Yes, I think bus still is the most common way for citizens because of the completed public transportation system. Sometimes the destination is far away and it will take us more than an hour to get there, but we still could get everywhere in the city by bus. I'd say it is really convenient for us.
4. Do people in your country take the bus?

Definitely! I could say I cannot live without computer now. Computer truly brought convenience to us from study to work, from office time to leisure time. Our life would be totally different if there's no computer.


# Email

5. How do you feel when you receive emails?
 To be honest, I always feel a little bit nervous when I receive emails, I know it sounds weird but I really do. Maybe because I don't know what's inside of the email before I click it and people often get scared of the unknown things.

Of course are those emails that contain good news. For me and also for most of students who are taking this exam, I believe the answer would be a school offer because that's what I am fighting for. 

7. How do you communicate with others at work-by emails or is it more convenient?

3. Do you want to live with your family in the future?

4. Are you close to all of your family members?    
Not all of them, but most of them. Chinese have close family relationships and we tend to live as one big family. Therefore, I am close to most of my family members, except for those who are living in other cities.

It is necessary to get together with friends and I always hang out with my friends just for fun. We watch movies, play games, you know, just some normal things. However, staying with friends always makes me feel happy and free, I don't have to think that much and just be who I am.    

3.  How do you make friends?     
I just share my interests with them and find a common topic between us, so that we have something to talk about. Most of my friends are from my work, because I am busy with work and I don't have much time or chance to meet people from other places.    

4. Do you have many friends?    
Actually, not that many but I do have some close friends. Talking about friends, I think the quality counts more than quantity. I don't need too many friends, but I need someone who could be with me when I am upset, it means a lot to me.    

5. Do you like chatting with friends online?    
Yes, I do, although chatting online doesn't feel as good as talking face to face, it still provides a convenient way to communicate with friends, especially for those who live in a different city. It makes the world smaller and helps us to keep in touch with old friends.
