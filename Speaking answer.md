4. Is boat trip popular in your country?
Actually, boat trip is not that popular in China, because China is a continental country and there are not many chances for citizens to have a boat trip. However, if I have a chance to travel by boat, I would like to try it since it will be a totally different experience for me.

3. Is it convenient to take the bus in your city?
Yes, I think bus still is the most common way for citizens because of the completed public transportation system. Sometimes the destination is far away and it will take us more than an hour to get there, but we still could get everywhere in the city by bus. I'd say it is really convenient for us.
4. Do people in your country take the bus?

3.  How do you make friends?     
I just share my interests with them and find a common topic between us, so that we have something to talk about. Most of my friends are from my work, because I am busy with work and I don't have much time or chance to meet people from other places.    

4. Do you have many friends?    
Actually, not that many but I do have some close friends. Talking about friends, I think the quality counts more than quantity. I don't need too many friends, but I need someone who could be with me when I am upset, it means a lot to me.    

5. Do you like chatting with friends online?    
Yes, I do, although chatting online doesn't feel as good as talking face to face, it still provides a convenient way to communicate with friends, especially for those who live in a different city. It makes the world smaller and helps us to keep in touch with old friends.

5. What happened on your first day of high school?
