2. Do you like boats?

3. Would you like to have your own boat?
Yes, of course, I would like to have my own boat, but the boat that I want is not like those fishermen's. I like those fancy ones and somehow a fancy boat represents the wealth, I wish my dream could come true one day.

Actually, boat trip is not that popular in China, because China is a continental country and there are not many chances for citizens to have a boat trip. However, if I have a chance to travel by boat, I would like to try it since it will be a totally different experience for me.

Actually, I should say that I take the bus almost every day and it is really convenient for us to take a bus to everywhere we want, I admit that public transportation has been developed really well these days.
